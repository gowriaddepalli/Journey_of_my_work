- I strive for achieving clarity in the things I do with the aim to develop it into a bigger picture while making an impact).
- I may be bit haywire, I am in the process of untangling myself.

 -> **How to build robust large scale products ??**
 
 ## Key Subjects Of Interest: (That's a lot, but life is about learning!)

## Journey





## Current skill focus:
